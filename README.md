* Implementation of a Transformer model in PyTorch for text classification.

* Built completely from scratch without using high-level libraries.

* Classifies text into sentiment labels like positive, negative, extremely negative, etc.

* Includes custom Transformer encoder, tokenization, training, and evaluation loops.

* Supports saving and loading model checkpoints for reuse.
